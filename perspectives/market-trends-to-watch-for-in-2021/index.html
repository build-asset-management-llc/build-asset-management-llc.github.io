In our 2020 recap below, we’ll talk through some of the key trends advisors should be paying attention to such as market unpredictability, a weakening dollar, bond valuations, fixed income yields, and what advisors should be looking at going forward. We believe these trends provide strong justification for innovative advisors to consider Build’s Indexed Risk Control series of strategies to help their clients achieve long-term success.</p>
<h2 id="predicting-what-the-market-will-do-next-remains-impossible">Predicting What the Market Will Do Next Remains Impossible</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Equity markets sold off sharply in the first quarter of 2020 as a surge in COVID-19 cases worldwide precipitated global economic shut down, ending a nearly 11-year bull run and introducing one of the steepest bear markets in history. Bond markets rallied over the year as investors sought safe havens to weather the economic storm and continued to perform even during the equity market recovery. Had investors reduced their allocation to equities in the first quarter in 2020 they would have almost certainly missed some portion of the market recovery that began in April, as history shows that timing the markets with any success is next to impossible. What Investors need are investment strategies designed for the long-term, and to both protect them against severe drawdowns as well as provide opportunities for capital appreciation over time. 2020 is a good reminder of how very true and important this is.” — Shinda Bickham, Client Portfolio Manager</p>

<h2 id="us-economic-growthand-us-dollar-strengthfaces-a-steep-climb-back">US Economic Growth—and US Dollar Strength—Faces a Steep Climb Back</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The onset of the pandemic in the U.S. in 2020 prompted a reversal in Dollar strength. Policy actions enacted to support capital markets and stimulate the economy added to the U.S. debt load, which will need to be financed by future borrowing. Growth expectations for the U.S. economy have collapsed, and a return to trend growth could take years to materialize. Higher yields in the long end will only be bullish for the U.S. Dollar when they are driven by positive developments in growth expectations, rather than supply considerations. Until a more pronounced series of encouraging economic data materializes, we expect the Dollar weakness story will continue to play out in 2021.” — Dustin Qualley, Portfolio Manager</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-red-hot-bond-market-could-be-a-sign-of-overvaluation">A Red-Hot Bond Market Could be a Sign of Overvaluation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The supply of corporate bonds rated BBB- or higher will be a record according to Bloomberg-32% above the previous record issuance year of 2017. What is so amazing about this deluge of supply is the price volatility that corporate bonds and all other asset classes faced as COVID lockdown gripped the economy. Option adjusted spreads for this sector began the year at around 95 basis points. At the height of the pandemic spreads had widened out to 373 basis points. As we end the year, spreads have come back nearly the entire way at roughly 100 basis points. Is this price movement, coupled with the massive supply, indicative of endless demand for corporate credit from investors? Or is this a flashing yellow light warning bond buyers of an over-valued asset class?” — Hugh Tuomey, Client Portfolio Manager</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="active-fixed-income-management-can-help-mitigate-negative-impacts-of-a-steepening-yield-curve">Active Fixed Income Management Can Help Mitigate Negative Impacts of a Steepening Yield Curve</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“While front-end rates remain at the zero-bound, the yield curve steepened as investors priced in expected increases in debt issuance and a rebound in inflation expectations. While a positively sloped yield curve creates a favorable environment for lenders and could signal expectations for future growth, rising rates could pressure returns for fixed income investors. An actively managed fixed income core can manage the negative effects of steepening by limiting its interest rate exposure. — Dustin Qualley, Portfolio Manager</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="advisors-who-apply-critical-long-term-thinking-will-be-best-positioned-to-help-their-clients">Advisors Who Apply Critical Long Term Thinking Will Be Best Positioned to Help Their Clients</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The key events of 2020 showed the importance of understanding events through a long-term framework and lens. The headline events - including the COVID-19 pandemic, polarized US elections, and widespread social protest and unrest — lay out a compelling case that we’re living through a period of upheaval and likely transition. To successfully guide clients through this period with their long-term financial plan and goals intact, it is critical, now more than ever, that advisors apply active critical thinking, do their own research, and determine the best approach and framework if their clients are to stay on course toward achieving their desired outcomes for their financial future. I expect the coming years ahead to be an era of opportunity for the forward-thinking advisor. Those advisors who position their clients with a successful approach to address risks in this period of turmoil will potentially separate from their peers and thrive. Those who do not risk falling significantly behind.” — Matt Dines, Co-founder &#x26; CIO</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the historic 2020 calendar year has passed, the futures of financial, political, and social conditions remain uncertain. Having an asset class that is built to provide downside protection while still participating in upswings can buffer some of the volatility that 2021 may bring. Build’s Indexed Risk Control strategies work backwards from providing the best aspects of actively managed fixed income with an innovative long call options overlay tied to equity markets. We have conviction that this strategy will provide investors with much-needed downside protection while taking the guesswork out of long-term equity market participation. <a href="https://getbuilding.com">Click here</a> for more on how to apply Indexed Risk Control™ into your clients’ portfolios.</p>  </div> </article>  </div> </section>  </article>  </main> <footer> <section class="p-12 md:p-20 bg-ink-500 text-white"> <div class="w-full max-w-7xl mx-auto">  <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 items-center justify-center gap-8 font-sans"> <div class="flex flex-col space-y-4"> <picture> <source srcset="/_astro/full-jade-white.DoxshJqy_2cIxJ2.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/_astro/full-jade-white.DoxshJqy_Zm1FME.webp" type="image/webp">  <img src="/_astro/full-jade-white.DoxshJqy_Z1zEGL2.png" alt="Build Asset Management logo" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1305" height="447" class="h-20 w-auto"> </picture> <ul class="flex flex-wrap items-center gap-4"> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BuildMarkets" aria-label="YouTube"> <svg width="1em" height="1em" class="block h-10 w-10" data-icon="mdi:youtube">   <symbol id="ai:mdi:youtube" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="m10 15l5.19-3L10 9zm11.56-7.83c.13.47.22 1.1.28 1.9c.07.8.1 1.49.1 2.09L22 12c0 2.19-.16 3.8-.44 4.83c-.25.9-.83 1.48-1.73 1.73c-.47.13-1.33.22-2.65.28c-1.3.07-2.49.1-3.59.1L12 19c-4.19 0-6.8-.16-7.83-.44c-.9-.25-1.48-.83-1.73-1.73c-.13-.47-.22-1.1-.28-1.9c-.07-.8-.1-1.49-.1-2.09L2 12c0-2.19.16-3.8.44-4.83c.25-.9.83-1.48 1.73-1.73c.47-.13 1.33-.22 2.65-.28c1.3-.07 2.49-.1 3.59-.1L12 5c4.19 0 6.8.16 7.83.44c.9.25 1.48.83 1.73 1.73"/></symbol><use href="#ai:mdi:youtube"></use>  </svg> </a></li><li><a href="https://www.x.com/BuildMarkets" aria-label="𝕏"> <svg width="1em" height="1em" class="block h-10 w-10" data-icon="mdi:twitter">   <symbol id="ai:mdi:twitter" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M22.46 6c-.77.35-1.6.58-2.46.69c.88-.53 1.56-1.37 1.88-2.38c-.83.5-1.75.85-2.72 1.05C18.37 4.5 17.26 4 16 4c-2.35 0-4.27 1.92-4.27 4.29c0 .34.04.67.11.98C8.28 9.09 5.11 7.38 3 4.79c-.37.63-.58 1.37-.58 2.15c0 1.49.75 2.81 1.91 3.56c-.71 0-1.37-.2-1.95-.5v.03c0 2.08 1.48 3.82 3.44 4.21a4.2 4.2 0 0 1-1.93.07a4.28 4.28 0 0 0 4 2.98a8.52 8.52 0 0 1-5.33 1.84q-.51 0-1.02-.06C3.44 20.29 5.7 21 8.12 21C16 21 20.33 14.46 20.33 8.79c0-.19 0-.37-.01-.56c.84-.6 1.56-1.36 2.14-2.23"/></symbol><use href="#ai:mdi:twitter"></use>  </svg> </a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/build-asset-management/" aria-label="LinkedIn"> <svg width="1em" height="1em" class="block h-10 w-10" data-icon="mdi:linkedin">   <symbol id="ai:mdi:linkedin" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19 3a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V5a2 2 0 0 1 2-2zm-.5 15.5v-5.3a3.26 3.26 0 0 0-3.26-3.26c-.85 0-1.84.52-2.32 1.3v-1.11h-2.79v8.37h2.79v-4.93c0-.77.62-1.4 1.39-1.4a1.4 1.4 0 0 1 1.4 1.4v4.93zM6.88 8.56a1.68 1.68 0 0 0 1.68-1.68c0-.93-.75-1.69-1.68-1.69a1.69 1.69 0 0 0-1.69 1.69c0 .93.76 1.68 1.69 1.68m1.39 9.94v-8.37H5.5v8.37z"/></symbol><use href="#ai:mdi:linkedin"></use>  </svg> </a></li> </ul> <ul class="flex flex-wrap items-center gap-4"> <li><a href="/form-adv-2a.pdf">Form ADV 2A</a></li> <li><a href="/form-crs.pdf">Form CRS</a></li> <li><a href="/privacy-notice.pdf">Privacy Notice</a></li> </ul> </div> <div> <h4>Subscribe for Updates</h4> <div class="flex shadow-md"> <div class="relative flex-grow"> <input type="email" id="emailInput-67ebc0e0-7c22-471b-b3fb-5df43e43fba2" name="email" placeholder="Email address" class="peer w-full p-4 border border-grays-100 placeholder-grays-100 outline-none focus:outline focus:border-jade-500 focus:invalid:border-burgundy-500" required aria-describedby="email-error"> <p class="invisible absolute left-0 right-0 text-sm text-burgundy-500 transition-opacity duration-300 peer-placeholder-shown:!invisible peer-invalid:visible" aria-live="polite">

Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.</p> <p>IMPORTANT RISK INFORMATION: An investment in the fund involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results.</p> <p>The fund's investment objective is to seek capital appreciation and risk mitigation. The funds are new and have a limited operating history.</p> <strong>Summary of Risk Factors</strong> <p>AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND INVOLVES RISKS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL.</p> <p>In general, investment in the shares of the Fund ("Shares") involves various risks, including but not limited to:</p> <ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-4 mb-2 md:mb-4"> <li>Limited operating history. There can be no assurance that Build's principals and affiliates will be able to duplicate prior investment success or that we will achieve our objectives or achieve positive results of any kind.</li> <li>Investors in the Fund may pay significantly more or receive significantly less for Fund shares than the value of the Fund's underlying securities or the NAV of Fund shares.</li> <li>The Fund is actively managed, which may result in higher brokerage costs or mark-up charges, which are ultimately pass on to shareholders of the Fund. Active trading may also result in adverse tax consequences.</li> <li>Fixed income risk, credit risk, extension risk, and prepayment risk could affect the value of a particular investment by the Fund, possibly causing the Fund's share price and total return to be reduced and fluctuate more than other types of investments.</li> <li>Derivatives risk, which can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices than conventional securities.</li> <li>ETF structure risk as shares are not individually redeemable and an active trading market for the Fund's shares may not be developed or maintained.</li> <li>General investment risks as no assurance can be given that the investment strategies used will be successful under all or any market conditions.</li> </ul> <p>For further detail on risk factors, prospective investors should read the "Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund" section of the prospectus which discusses the risks and uncertainties believed to be material to the operations, operating results, prospects and financial conditions. Only by carefully reviewing and considering those factors and the rest of the Fund's prospectus (in addition to other independent investigations) can an investor determine whether such risks, as well as Build's experience and compensation, conflicts of interest and other information contained therein are acceptable to the investor.

The index includes Treasuries, government-related and corporate securities, fixed-rate agency MBS, ABS, and CMBS (agency and non-agency).</p> <p>Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs, and expenses and cannot be invested in directly.

Bloomberg does not guarantee the timeliness, accuracy, or completeness of any data or information relating to the Products.</p> <p>The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The Morningstar Rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads. The top 10% of products in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. The Fund was rated against the following numbers of Short-Term Bond funds over the following time periods: 525 funds in the last three years, N/A funds in the last five years, and N/A funds in the last ten years.

Fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk, the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Investing in mortgage- and asset-backed securities involves interest rate, credit, valuation, extension and liquidity risks and the risk that payments on the underlying assets are delayed, prepaid, subordinated or defaulted on.</p> <p>The Fund is actively managed, which means that investment decisions are made based on the Adviser's investment views. There is no guarantee that the investment views will produce the desired results or expected returns, which may cause the Fund to fail to meet its investment objective or to underperform its benchmark index or funds with similar investment objectives and strategies. The Fund invests in ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) and is therefore subject to the same risks as the underlying securities in which the ETF invests as well as entails higher expenses than if invested into the underlying ETF directly. While the option overlay is intended to improve the Fund's performance, there is no guarantee that it will do so. Utilizing an option overlay strategy involves the risk that as the buyer of a call option, the Fund risks losing the entire premium invested in the option if the Fund does not exercise the option. Also, securities and options traded in over-the-counter markets may trade less frequently and in limited volumes and thus exhibit more volatility and liquidity risk.</p> <p>Build does not guarantee any minimum level of investment performance or the success of any index portfolio, index, mutual fund or investment strategy. Past performance does not guarantee future results. There is a potential for loss in any investment, including loss of principal invested. All investments involve risk, and different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk. Investment recommendations will not always be profitable.</p> <p>Build ETFs are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.</p>  </div> </section> <section class="p-12 md:p-20 bg-ink-500 text-sm text-white py-2 md:py-4"> <div class="w-full max-w-7xl mx-auto">  <p>Build Asset Management, LLC (a/k/a Build Asset Management and/or GetBuilding.com) is an investment adviser registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
