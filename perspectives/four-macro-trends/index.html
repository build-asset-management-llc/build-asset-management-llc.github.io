The resultant market volatility has left many financial advisors unsure of what to do next, but savvy advisors know there are throughlines in the narrative. These are the four key macro trends we believe every advisor needs to be watching to drive their clients’ success.</p>
<h1 id="trend-1-energy-supply-crunch">Trend 1: Energy Supply Crunch</h1>
<p>International conflict, extreme weather, policy decisions, and underinvestment in energy production have led to an energy supply crunch. Europe has felt the sting of this crunch first, with Russia’s Nord Stream pipelines reducing natural gas output, historically low water levels along several critical waterways which are used to transport energy-related materials, and the closure of many coal-fired and nuclear power plants due to energy policy mandates. The United States has avoided Europe’s energy price spikes so far due to its own ability to produce energy and by drawing down stock from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The US has released ~150 million barrels of oil since its initial announcement in November 2021 and is releasing about one million barrels per day from the SPR at least through October. The reserve is finite and will eventually need to be replenished. Ideally, this replenishment will occur when oil prices are lower, or at least falling.</p>
<figure><p><img src="/_astro/spr-inventory.B1ij14gy_Z1dSrAo.webp" alt="Strategic Petroleum Reserve Total Inventory (DOESSPR)" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="624" height="632">
<figcaption>Strategic Petroleum Reserve Total Inventory (DOESSPR). Source: Bloomberg</figcaption></p></figure>
<p>Advisors should pay close attention to upstream energy supplier metrics as a leading indicator of where energy prices will go. Russia closing natural gas through Nord Stream pipelines, Germany potentially nationalizing Uniper, and other investments in the energy production space will be critically important as the world finds ways to fill demand for energy.</p>
<h1 id="trend-2-shrinking-labor-market-demographics">Trend 2: Shrinking Labor Market Demographics</h1>
<p>As of this post, US labor force participation has not recovered to its pre-pandemic levels and even before that, the US hadn’t recovered to pre-global financial crisis participation rates. During the depths of pandemic lockdowns, many employees either quit their jobs due to health concerns, were laid off, or retired. In particular, the Baby Boom Generation had already entered a period of rapid workforce exit into retirement, and the pandemic pulled forward that exit decision for many of them. While the Millennial Generation will be the largest US generation in history, younger cohorts are smaller and birth rates are in decline. Two factors driving the decline in birth rates are increased industrialization and urbanization of society as well as increasing housing affordability problems. These factors show no signs of abating and will continue to suppress the need and desire to have large families.</p>
<figure><p><img src="/_astro/employment-population-ratio.5dthGKiV_ZXDDBy.webp" alt="Employment-Population Ratio" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="624" height="240">
<figcaption>Employment-Population Ratio. Source: FRED</figcaption></p></figure>
<p>Employment metrics will be the indicators to watch as companies need to fill their roles left open by employees leaving the workforce or fuel their growth with new positions. As the supply of working age adults falls, the labor market could see widespread wage increases as the demand for labor builds.</p>
<figure><p><img src="/_astro/us-population-pyramid.CCJHATsf_ZfHpll.webp" alt="US Population Pyramid" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1430" height="646">
<figcaption>US Population Pyramid. Source: USAFacts</figcaption></p></figure>
<p>A declining population growth rate will have long-term impacts on the price of labor and overall productivity of the economy. The worst outcome would be a secular, stagflationary period with the double-whammy of sustained inflation and lack of GDP growth.</p>
<h1 id="trend-3-changing-inflationary-regime">Trend 3: Changing Inflationary Regime</h1>
<p>Since the early 1980s, Americans have not been accustomed to dramatic inflationary episodes. Breakeven inflation, measured by the difference between nominal bond yields and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) yields, turned negative towards the end of 2008 during the Global Financial Crisis. The Fed began its Quantitative Easing program by cutting interest rates at this time to avoid deflation and rates have stayed near zero since then until recent rate hikes. Energy and labor prices have already contributed to an 8.5% consumer price index (CPI) print in July, one of the largest year-over-year increases since 1982. In addition, rent prices increased 6.2% year-over-year as of August. These are prices that underlie nearly everything in the economy and can lead to inflation continuing to stay elevated for the foreseeable future.</p>

<figcaption>Consumer Price Index 12-Month Percentage Change by Category. Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</figcaption></p></figure>
<p>Advisors need to pay attention to signals that inflation will stay elevated for a long period of time. That will have strong implications on long-term Fed policy and bond yields. Positioning a portfolio on the assumption that we will be quickly back to 1-2% inflation and easy monetary policy may not be the best course of action until we see more data. A defensive posture is still advisable until inflation and growth signals are clearer.</p>
<h1 id="trend-4-global-dollar-supply-shortage">Trend 4: Global Dollar Supply Shortage</h1>
<p>Eurodollars are US dollars held outside the US and are thus outside the jurisdiction of the Fed. While the Fed can print “unlimited” amounts of money, that printing interacts with the market in the form of bank reserves, not dollars themselves. As domestic banks increase their reserves, they can lend more, with some of those loans going to foreign banks. Those foreign banks can then issue dollar-denominated loans (Eurodollar loans), which eventually need to be paid back with dollars. The US dollar index (DXY) is where the dollar shortage can be clearly seen, with the index steadily rising since 2021 and continuing to peak. Dollar strength is a positive for buyers using dollars to purchase foreign goods, but countries with dollar shortages will likely see their currencies inflate, limiting their ability to purchase supplies needed to create the goods they would export to the US and receive dollars for. These second order effects can impact the US economy through further supply chain disruption, food shortages, and geopolitical instability.</p>

<h1 id="what-advisors-can-do">What Advisors Can Do</h1>
<p>The result? An increasingly complex set of factors that impact market conditions in unprecedented ways. The previous rules-of-thumb are not applicable to the current environment. Advisors know these conditions are not like we’ve seen before – and likely require previously uncommon investment strategies to properly mitigate for the risks ahead. Uncertainty is the common thread between all the above macro trends. This uncertainty has led to strategies like the 60/40 portfolio to underperform as they attempt to provide everything from a simple mix of stocks and bonds: income, growth, inflation protection, and downside protection. In the face of these macro trends, advisors will likely need to lean into previously uncommon alternative sectors and instruments: option overlays, long/short strategies, and commodities to name a few. Advisors will also be leaning into safety and liquidity, most likely found in cash and the front end of the US Treasury yield curve. With the 1yr Treasury yielding over 4%, playing it safe to get more clarity on inflation and macro trends through the winter might be a wise strategy. Investigate the strengths and weaknesses of alternative strategies and consider how they offer different features from a standard stock/bond mix. On the fixed income side, where Build Asset Management’s expertise is focused, advisors can look to <a href="/perspectives/inflation-uncertainty-makes-duration-trade-a-balancing-act/">customizing their clients’ duration mix</a> and determine <a href="/etfs/bfix/">whether overlay strategies like the Build Bond Innovation ETF (BFIX)</a> make sense, to name a few. BFIX seeks to provide investors with three key attributes for addressing today’s uncertainty: low volatility, an attractive total return profile, and liquidity, while seeking to beat its benchmark (the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index) over a full market cycle. We developed this strategy using the same underlying securities that retirement investors know and understand (bonds and stocks) but by deploying them in a novel way. Specifically, we use investment grade fixed income with a duration shorter than the benchmark for volatility reduction and a modest amount of dividend income, and we use small amounts of equity options to seek a total return profile greater than the benchmark. Engineering your clients’ portfolios to take advantage of helpful features of an asset, while improving its upside or mitigating its downside with cooperative features of an alternative asset. BFIX is an example of this approach, taking fixed income’s feature of historically lower volatility and seeking to improve its upside with options.</p>  </div> </article>  </div> </section>  </article>  </main> <footer> <section class="p-12 md:p-20 bg-ink-500 text-white"> <div class="w-full max-w-7xl mx-auto">  <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 items-center justify-center gap-8 font-sans"> <div class="flex flex-col space-y-4"> <picture> <source srcset="/_astro/full-jade-white.DoxshJqy_2cIxJ2.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/_astro/full-jade-white.DoxshJqy_Zm1FME.webp" type="image/webp">  <img src="/_astro/full-jade-white.DoxshJqy_Z1zEGL2.png" alt="Build Asset Management logo" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1305" height="447" class="h-20 w-auto"> </picture> <ul class="flex flex-wrap items-center gap-4"> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BuildMarkets" aria-label="YouTube"> <svg width="1em" height="1em" class="block h-10 w-10" data-icon="mdi:youtube">   <symbol id="ai:mdi:youtube" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="m10 15l5.19-3L10 9zm11.56-7.83c.13.47.22 1.1.28 1.9c.07.8.1 1.49.1 2.09L22 12c0 2.19-.16 3.8-.44 4.83c-.25.9-.83 1.48-1.73 1.73c-.47.13-1.33.22-2.65.28c-1.3.07-2.49.1-3.59.1L12 19c-4.19 0-6.8-.16-7.83-.44c-.9-.25-1.48-.83-1.73-1.73c-.13-.47-.22-1.1-.28-1.9c-.07-.8-.1-1.49-.1-2.09L2 12c0-2.19.16-3.8.44-4.83c.25-.9.83-1.48 1.73-1.73c.47-.13 1.33-.22 2.65-.28c1.3-.07 2.49-.1 3.59-.1L12 5c4.19 0 6.8.16 7.83.44c.9.25 1.48.83 1.73 1.73"/></symbol><use href="#ai:mdi:youtube"></use>  </svg> </a></li><li><a href="https://www.x.com/BuildMarkets" aria-label="𝕏"> <svg width="1em" height="1em" class="block h-10 w-10" data-icon="mdi:twitter">   <symbol id="ai:mdi:twitter" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M22.46 6c-.77.35-1.6.58-2.46.69c.88-.53 1.56-1.37 1.88-2.38c-.83.5-1.75.85-2.72 1.05C18.37 4.5 17.26 4 16 4c-2.35 0-4.27 1.92-4.27 4.29c0 .34.04.67.11.98C8.28 9.09 5.11 7.38 3 4.79c-.37.63-.58 1.37-.58 2.15c0 1.49.75 2.81 1.91 3.56c-.71 0-1.37-.2-1.95-.5v.03c0 2.08 1.48 3.82 3.44 4.21a4.2 4.2 0 0 1-1.93.07a4.28 4.28 0 0 0 4 2.98a8.52 8.52 0 0 1-5.33 1.84q-.51 0-1.02-.06C3.44 20.29 5.7 21 8.12 21C16 21 20.33 14.46 20.33 8.79c0-.19 0-.37-.01-.56c.84-.6 1.56-1.36 2.14-2.23"/></symbol><use href="#ai:mdi:twitter"></use>  </svg> </a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/build-asset-management/" aria-label="LinkedIn"> <svg width="1em" height="1em" class="block h-10 w-10" data-icon="mdi:linkedin">   <symbol id="ai:mdi:linkedin" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19 3a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V5a2 2 0 0 1 2-2zm-.5 15.5v-5.3a3.26 3.26 0 0 0-3.26-3.26c-.85 0-1.84.52-2.32 1.3v-1.11h-2.79v8.37h2.79v-4.93c0-.77.62-1.4 1.39-1.4a1.4 1.4 0 0 1 1.4 1.4v4.93zM6.88 8.56a1.68 1.68 0 0 0 1.68-1.68c0-.93-.75-1.69-1.68-1.69a1.69 1.69 0 0 0-1.69 1.69c0 .93.76 1.68 1.69 1.68m1.39 9.94v-8.37H5.5v8.37z"/></symbol><use href="#ai:mdi:linkedin"></use>  </svg> </a></li> </ul> <ul class="flex flex-wrap items-center gap-4"> <li><a href="/form-adv-2a.pdf">Form ADV 2A</a></li> <li><a href="/form-crs.pdf">Form CRS</a></li> <li><a href="/privacy-notice.pdf">Privacy Notice</a></li> </ul> </div> <div> <h4>Subscribe for Updates</h4> <div class="flex shadow-md"> <div class="relative flex-grow"> <input type="email" id="emailInput-ef8b940f-324b-4624-a616-5ea6aa29881b" name="email" placeholder="Email address" class="peer w-full p-4 border border-grays-100 placeholder-grays-100 outline-none focus:outline focus:border-jade-500 focus:invalid:border-burgundy-500" required aria-describedby="email-error"> <p class="invisible absolute left-0 right-0 text-sm text-burgundy-500 transition-opacity duration-300 peer-placeholder-shown:!invisible peer-invalid:visible" aria-live="polite">

Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.</p> <p>IMPORTANT RISK INFORMATION: An investment in the fund involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results.</p> <p>The fund's investment objective is to seek capital appreciation and risk mitigation. The funds are new and have a limited operating history.</p> <strong>Summary of Risk Factors</strong> <p>AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND INVOLVES RISKS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL.</p> <p>In general, investment in the shares of the Fund ("Shares") involves various risks, including but not limited to:</p> <ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-4 mb-2 md:mb-4"> <li>Limited operating history. There can be no assurance that Build's principals and affiliates will be able to duplicate prior investment success or that we will achieve our objectives or achieve positive results of any kind.</li> <li>Investors in the Fund may pay significantly more or receive significantly less for Fund shares than the value of the Fund's underlying securities or the NAV of Fund shares.</li> <li>The Fund is actively managed, which may result in higher brokerage costs or mark-up charges, which are ultimately pass on to shareholders of the Fund. Active trading may also result in adverse tax consequences.</li> <li>Fixed income risk, credit risk, extension risk, and prepayment risk could affect the value of a particular investment by the Fund, possibly causing the Fund's share price and total return to be reduced and fluctuate more than other types of investments.</li> <li>Derivatives risk, which can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices than conventional securities.</li> <li>ETF structure risk as shares are not individually redeemable and an active trading market for the Fund's shares may not be developed or maintained.</li> <li>General investment risks as no assurance can be given that the investment strategies used will be successful under all or any market conditions.</li> </ul> <p>For further detail on risk factors, prospective investors should read the "Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund" section of the prospectus which discusses the risks and uncertainties believed to be material to the operations, operating results, prospects and financial conditions. Only by carefully reviewing and considering those factors and the rest of the Fund's prospectus (in addition to other independent investigations) can an investor determine whether such risks, as well as Build's experience and compensation, conflicts of interest and other information contained therein are acceptable to the investor.

The index includes Treasuries, government-related and corporate securities, fixed-rate agency MBS, ABS, and CMBS (agency and non-agency).</p> <p>Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur management fees, costs, and expenses and cannot be invested in directly.

Bloomberg does not guarantee the timeliness, accuracy, or completeness of any data or information relating to the Products.</p> <p>The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The Morningstar Rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads. The top 10% of products in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. The Fund was rated against the following numbers of Short-Term Bond funds over the following time periods: 525 funds in the last three years, N/A funds in the last five years, and N/A funds in the last ten years.

Fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk, the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Investing in mortgage- and asset-backed securities involves interest rate, credit, valuation, extension and liquidity risks and the risk that payments on the underlying assets are delayed, prepaid, subordinated or defaulted on.</p> <p>The Fund is actively managed, which means that investment decisions are made based on the Adviser's investment views. There is no guarantee that the investment views will produce the desired results or expected returns, which may cause the Fund to fail to meet its investment objective or to underperform its benchmark index or funds with similar investment objectives and strategies. The Fund invests in ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) and is therefore subject to the same risks as the underlying securities in which the ETF invests as well as entails higher expenses than if invested into the underlying ETF directly. While the option overlay is intended to improve the Fund's performance, there is no guarantee that it will do so. Utilizing an option overlay strategy involves the risk that as the buyer of a call option, the Fund risks losing the entire premium invested in the option if the Fund does not exercise the option. Also, securities and options traded in over-the-counter markets may trade less frequently and in limited volumes and thus exhibit more volatility and liquidity risk.</p> <p>Build does not guarantee any minimum level of investment performance or the success of any index portfolio, index, mutual fund or investment strategy. Past performance does not guarantee future results. There is a potential for loss in any investment, including loss of principal invested. All investments involve risk, and different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk. Investment recommendations will not always be profitable.</p> <p>Build ETFs are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.</p>  </div> </section> <section class="p-12 md:p-20 bg-ink-500 text-sm text-white py-2 md:py-4"> <div class="w-full max-w-7xl mx-auto">  <p>Build Asset Management, LLC (a/k/a Build Asset Management and/or GetBuilding.com) is an investment adviser registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
